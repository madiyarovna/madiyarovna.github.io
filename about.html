          I have been living in the city of Taraz since birth. There I was born,
          lived, studied, met my friends. I love my city very much, because it's
          so small and cozy. Taraz is considered one of the oldest cities in
          Kazakhstan. It is a place where life does not fly at a frantic pace,
          but flows. It flows calmly and peacefully. The city itself is steeped
          in an atmosphere of kinship.

          I have been dancing since I was 5. And it is passion of my life. Now I
          dance hip-hop. When I feel sad I just start dancing and improvising.
          It helps me feel better immediately because every movement and leap,
          every step and turn makes the world around me brighter. When I dance I
          forget about everything. So my hobby is my medicine too. And it keeps
          me physically fit.
