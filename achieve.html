             My first extracurricular achievement was that I won a medal in
            annual inter schools swimming competition in 5th grade. Also, I'm
            keen on dancing and I helped my team win the tournament, in class
            9th. I was awarded as the best dancer.

           My first academic achievements is that in 10th grade I won several
            medals on Worlds Scholars Cup. It was my first experience in
            debates. Also, on the basis of good scores and my perseverance, I
            got study scholarship for AITU. I really love studying here.

            A personal achievement is an attribute that provides an individual
            with a sense of pride. This can originate from many different
            sources. To do sports, to take care of my health. Not to stop on the
            achieved, to go further and develop both on a physical and spiritual
            level.
